    question: 'What is CaskChain?',
    answer: `CaskChain is a platform that offers NFTs (digital assets) directly from luxury liquor brands. Each NFT corresponds to a physical cask. Consumers have the ability to exchange the digital version for the physical version. In simple terms, consumers own the physical cask, CaskChain stores it for them, and the digital version serves as proof of authenticity, verification of ownership, and the right to have the physical cask delivered. CaskChain proves authenticity via Ethereum’s blockchain. By buying the NFT directly from the brand, we not only make the process easier, but we ensure that your asset has proven authenticity. Whether you grow your collection, send it as a gift, or resell it, authenticity will never be an issue. CaskChain ensures 100% instant authenticity to all collectors up until the moment they redeem the cask. More so, we offer this service with no commitment. Our platform will still be selling exclusive casks directly from the brands at MSRP and consumers have the ability to pay by credit card and can redeem the cask immediately.`,

    question: 'What are the fees?',
    answer: `CaskChain’s fee structure is very simple.
      Collectors receive 90% of their selling price. The remaining percentage is split between CaskChain and the Brands.
      These fees help cover CaskChain’s warehouse, insurance and shipping fees. You do not pay any additional fees for storage or insurance.
      Shipping fees and duties will be charged to redeemer upon redemption.`,

    question: 'How are the casks stored?',
    answer: `Our brands ship the casks directly to CaskChain’s secure warehouse in Singapore. This warehouse is bonded, temperature controlled and insured. Storing your own spirits is extremely difficult and expensive so CaskChain takes care of this for you.`,
  },

    question: 'How do I get the actual cask?',
    answer: `If you own a cask on CaskChain you can redeem it at any point from the My Collection page. Find the cask in your collection and tap the Redeem button below it. When you Redeem your cask you will be “burning” the digital version in order to receive the physical version (one is exchanged for the other), which means one less digital NFT will exist. There is also no returning from this, you will not have access to the digital token anymore so make sure you are ready for this!
      When you redeem it you will be asked to enter your shipping address. You will need to be in full compliance of your jurisdiction. We will ship your cask safely using priority and insured mail.
      Redeemer will be required to pay shipping and duties. These fees are only triggered by redeeming the physical cask.`,

    quesiton: 'What happens if I sell my digital NFT?',
    answer: `
        If you sell your digital bottle on the marketplace the bottle will automatically be transferred to the buyer. All of this is documented and can be viewed on Etherscan as well as the BlockBar website. The value of the sale in Ether will automatically be added to your Ethereum wallet that you connected. The bottle will no longer appear in your Collection page and you will not be able to redeem it, gift it or sell it.

    question: 'What can I do after I buy the bottle?',
    answer: `
    BlockBar takes the pain out of spirits and wine investing. Once you have the bottle you can always check it out on your Collection page. From the Collection page you are able to Gift it to a friend; List it for sale; Redeem it for the actual bottle or just hold on to it. If you haven’t yet connected your Ethereum wallet to BlockBar we recommend doing that to complete the transfer of any bottles to your own wallet.
    Other users can also bid on your bottle even if it is not for sale. These bids last 3 days and you can accept them by following the link in your email or from the My Collection page.

    question: 'How do I sell my bottle?',
    answer: `
    Once you own a bottle you can list it for sale at any point from the My Collection page. Find your bottle in your collection and tap the Sell button. From there you will be able to see some basic stats on the bottle and list it for sale. You will only receive the money if another user on BlockBar buys it so you need to think about the price that you want to list it.
    Bottles that are listed for sale stay for sale until someone buys it or you remove your listing. At any point if your bottle is listed for sale you can remove it by visiting the My Collection page, finding the bottle and tapping the Remove Listing button.
